# Math and CS Exercises Compendium

This is a Math and CS Exercise Compendium.

The point is to gather, from disparate sources, exercises and problems
for various topics that are important in CS, along with definitions.

By having all of these exercises in a single format that parses all the same,
my hope is to remove extraneous cognitive load in order to make room for
germane and intrinsic cognitive load.
